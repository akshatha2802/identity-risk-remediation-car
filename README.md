# Identity Risk Remediation & Credential Hygiene (CAR)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an enterprise-scale approach to identifying and remediating identity risks caused by weak, leaked, and reused credentials across large environments.

The work focuses on analyzing identity and security datasets, categorizing risk scenarios, tracking remediation progress, and enabling automated remediation workflows to improve credential hygiene and governance maturity.

---

## Problem
Large organizations often face identity risks such as:

- Weak or reused passwords  
- Leaked credentials  
- Non-compliant or stale accounts  
- Privileged accounts with elevated lateral movement risk  
- Lack of centralized remediation tracking  

Manual remediation processes are slow and difficult to scale.

---

## Solution
A structured remediation framework was implemented:

1. Aggregate identity and security datasets  
2. Perform pivot-based risk categorization  
3. Identify remediation scenarios  
4. Track remediation metrics and trends  
5. Support remediation workflows  
6. Validate and report compliance weekly
